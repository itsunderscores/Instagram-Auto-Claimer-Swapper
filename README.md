## Instagram Turbo / Auto Claimer / Swapper
Version: **2.3**<br>
Last Update: **12/13/2021**<br>
ffs, please don't sell this. I posted it for free so keep it that way. If you genuinely sell this, you're a piece of shit
<hr>

Use this at your own descretion. I've only used this on test accounts and nothing high-end. Although, it should get the job done.<br>

Proxies are required for this to work properly. **Rotating and Residential are recommended.** <br>
I will keep the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itsunderscores/Instagram-Auto-Claimer-Swapper/main/proxies.txt">proxies</a> file updated with fresh proxies for those who don't have access HQ proxies.


The program has three different settings. All which are currently functioning as of 12/11/2021.<br>
Before swapping a high-end account, ensure it is working with throwaway accounts first.

If you need helping swapping or cannot get this **simple** program working. Feel free to contact me.<br>

## Features
- Multi-threading
- Multiple Accounts
- Proxy Supported (Proxies.txt)

Tested and working on Python 3.9.9

## First Mode (Auto Claimer/Turbo):
Turbo/Auto-claim list of username(s).

* I recommend buying fresh accounts and using around 50+ accounts.
* Do not use more threads than accounts
* Good delay per request is 3
* Good timeout per request is 5

1) Put your login accounts in file **accounts.txt** in USERNAME:PASSWORD format, and choose option 3 before continuing.

2) It will go through the list of usernames in file **usernames.txt** and will see if the name is available.

## Second Mode (Swapper):
Mainly used to swap a username over to another account. **Updated to claim faster**

It will ask for the login of the first account that will be releasing the username. Then it'll ask for the second account login that will claim the username. Once it has verified that both accounts are working and eligble to transfer, it will swap them.

## Third Mode (Login to accounts):
Grab required cookies from accounts in **accounts.txt** (This is required for the first mode.)
